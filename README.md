## C1W1_Assignment: Housing Prices
In this assignment, a neural network was built to predict the price of a house based on a simple formula:
A house has a base cost of 50k, and every additional bedroom adds a cost of 50k.
For example, a 1-bedroom house costs 100k, a 2-bedroom house costs 150k, and so on. The model learns this relationship to predict the cost accurately.

## C1W2_Assignment: Implementing Callbacks in TensorFlow using the MNIST Dataset
This assignment focused on creating an MNIST classifier using TensorFlow. The objective was to train the model to achieve 99% accuracy and implement callbacks to stop training once this threshold is reached. 

## C1W3_Assignment: Improve MNIST with Convolutions
In this exercise, the MNIST classifier was enhanced by adding a single convolutional layer and a single MaxPooling 2D layer to achieve an accuracy of 99.5% or more. (C1W3_Assignment/) directory.

## C1W4_Assignment: Handling Complex Images - Happy or Sad Dataset
This assignment involved using the happy or sad dataset, which contains 80 images of emoji-like faces (40 happy, 40 sad). A convolutional neural network was created, achieving an impressive training accuracy of 99.9%. Training automatically stops upon reaching this accuracy threshold.
