<h2>C1W1_Assignment: Housing Prices</h2>
<p>In this assignment, a neural network was built to predict the price of a house based on a simple formula:</p>
<code>A house has a base cost of 50k, and every additional bedroom adds a cost of 50k. For example, a 1-bedroom house costs 100k, a 2-bedroom house costs 150k, and so on. The model learns this relationship to predict the cost accurately.</code>

<h2>C1W2_Assignment: Implementing Callbacks in TensorFlow using the MNIST Dataset</h2>
<p>This assignment focused on creating an MNIST classifier using TensorFlow. </p>
<code>The objective was to train the model to achieve 99% accuracy and implement callbacks to stop training once this threshold is reached.</code>

<h2>C1W3_Assignment: Improve MNIST with Convolutions</h2>
<p>In this exercise, the MNIST classifier was enhanced by adding a single convolutional layer and a single MaxPooling 2D layer to achieve an accuracy of 99.5% or more.</p>

<h2>C1W4_Assignment: Handling Complex Images - Happy or Sad Dataset</h2>
<p>This assignment involved using the happy or sad dataset, which contains 80 images of emoji-like faces (40 happy, 40 sad). </p>
<code>A convolutional neural network was created, achieving an impressive training accuracy of 99.9%. Training automatically stops upon reaching this accuracy threshold.</code>
